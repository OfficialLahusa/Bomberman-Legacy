# Bomberman Legacy
This is a **discontinued** Bomberman clone developed in 2019. The repository contains two Visual Studio C++ projects:

 1. **Bomberman** contains the discontinued core game
 2. **Networking Test** contains a UDP based client-server structure created as a research project into game servers, client prediction and entity interpolation
